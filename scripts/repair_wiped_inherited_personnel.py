scripts/repair_wiped_inherited_personnel.py

One-time repair for a bug in _do_confirm (app/api/ingest.py, fixed
2026-07-23): Batch Import's "Auto-Ingest" path never sends "members"/
"guests" in its confirm payload at all (no review wizard, no pre-fill). That
None got collapsed to [] before reaching sync_performance_personnel(), which
reads [] as "the user just cleared every member" — tripping its case-5
safeguard (an act-roster member disappearing from one show flips that show to
personnel_mode='explicit' and snapshots the surviving lineup). With nothing
in the list to keep, the snapshot was empty: the performance flipped to
'explicit' with zero performance_personnel rows, and its Members row on View
Recording came out blank even though the performer's own roster was intact.
(Ryan, 2026-07-23 — "Bela Fleck & Tony Trischka" ingested via Bulk Import.)

This finds every performance matching that exact signature — mode='explicit',
zero performance_personnel rows, AND the performer has at least one
Membership (so reverting to inherit actually restores something) — and
reverts personnel_mode back to 'inherit'. This is a clean, lossless revert:
there are zero performance_personnel rows to lose in either direction, same
as set_performance_personnel_mode()'s explicit→inherit path.

A performance with mode='explicit' and zero rows AND a performer with NO
roster at all is left alone — that's a legitimately personnel-less show
(nothing to revert to), not this bug's signature.

Idempotent: rerunning finds nothing (already-reverted rows are back in
'inherit' mode, which no longer matches the query).
