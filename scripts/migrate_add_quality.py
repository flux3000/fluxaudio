"""
scripts/migrate_add_quality.py — Listening Quality persistence.

Adds (all additive, idempotent, safe to re-run):
  quality_analysis   (new) — pre-ingest staging, keyed by source folder path
  recording_quality  (new) — permanent per-recording score

Nothing existing is touched and no row changes meaning: both tables are new and
start empty. See "Context Library/Unified Ingestion + Listening Quality —
Design Plan.md" §3 for why this is two tables rather than one.

FK NOTE: SQLite FK enforcement has been ON since 2026-07-22 and the live DB's
stale FK DDL was repaired then, so the `recording.id` references below are safe
to declare. `quality_analysis.recording_id` is ON DELETE SET NULL (the triage
decision outlives the recording); `recording_quality.recording_id` is ON DELETE
CASCADE (the score is meaningless without its recording).

Run once from the repo root:
