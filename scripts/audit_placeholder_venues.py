"""
audit_placeholder_venues.py — Read-only report on placeholder-named venues.

Ryan's 2026-07-15 bug report: "Unknown Venue" (and similar placeholder names
like "TBD", "N/A") get created once and then reused by name-match across
every recording that doesn't have a real venue yet. Since Venue is meant to
be one canonical physical place, this silently shares one row across shows
that are, in reality, all over the map — and any write to city/state/country
on that row (AI Assist, manual edit, the venue-picker's lockLocation) clobbers
whatever was there for every OTHER show parked on it.

This script makes NO changes. It just lists every placeholder-named Venue row
and every Performance/Recording currently pointing at it, so Ryan can see the
blast radius and decide what to do with each show's location data by hand.

Run:
    python3 scripts/audit_placeholder_venues.py
