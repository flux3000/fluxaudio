migrate_flux_audio_root.py — 2026-08-13

Repoint stored absolute paths after the Workshop/Library consolidation:

    /Volumes/music/Flux Workshop/{Backlog,Download,Working}  ->  /Volumes/music/Flux Audio/{Backlog,Download,Workshop}
    /Volumes/music/Flux Library                              ->  /Volumes/music/Flux Audio/Library

Only `quality_analysis` stores absolute paths (folder_path, source_dir).
Recording.folder_path and Track.file_path are relative to LIBRARY_ROOT and are
deliberately left alone — that is why the rename is cheap.

Idempotent: rows already pointing at the new root are skipped. Dry-run by
default; pass --commit to write. Takes a timestamped .bak of the DB first.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/migrate_flux_audio_root.py [--db db/fluxaudio.db] [--commit]
