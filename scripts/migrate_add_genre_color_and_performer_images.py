scripts/migrate_add_genre_color_and_performer_images.py

Two additive changes, 2026-08-07:

  1. `genre.color` — nullable `#rrggbb` string driving the Browse cards' colour
     flair, editable through a colour picker in the Genre editor. Seeded with a
     starting palette matched BY NAME against the genres actually in this DB;
     anything unmatched stays NULL and renders neutral grey, which is a
     supported state rather than a gap (70 of 164 performers have no genre at
     all).

  2. `performer_image` — multiple images per Performer with one flagged
     primary, replacing the single `performer.image_ext` slot.

Both additive and idempotent — safe to re-run.

`performer.image_ext` is deliberately NOT dropped. SQLite cannot drop a column
without a full table rebuild, and this project has already been bitten by
rebuild-adjacent DDL (the 2026-07-22 stale-FK episode, repaired by
tools/repair_stale_fk_ddl.py). The column is backfilled into `performer_image`
and then simply ignored by the application.

The backfill DOES NOT MOVE OR RENAME ANY FILE. The legacy image keeps its
`profile<ext>` name on disk and the new row records that name verbatim, so an
interrupted run can never orphan a photo — re-running just re-checks rows.

This touches neither `performance` nor `user_artist_permission`, so the
hardcoded DDL snapshots in tools/repair_stale_fk_ddl.py need no re-dump.

# Starting palette. Matched case-insensitively against genre.name, so it fits
# the vocabulary in THIS database (Ryan renamed the seeded 20 down to 14
# combined categories) rather than the original spec list. Chosen to stay
# legible on both themes' backgrounds — the dark theme is a warm near-black
# (#1a1714), the light a warm cream (#f0ebe3), so fully-saturated primaries
# read badly on one or the other. These are starting points; the whole reason
# the picker exists is that Ryan will disagree with some of them.
