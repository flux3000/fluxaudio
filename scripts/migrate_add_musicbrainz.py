"""
scripts/migrate_add_musicbrainz.py

Adds the MusicBrainz fact columns to `performer` (2026-08-07). Additive and
idempotent — safe to re-run.

Real columns rather than a JSON blob (Ryan's call): these are queryable facts
("which acts formed in New Orleans"), and a blob can't answer that.

Every column is nullable and every existing row keeps `mb_status = NULL`, which
the model documents as "never looked up" — distinct from 'none' ("looked, found
nothing"). That distinction is load-bearing: the performer page offers a Match
prompt for NULL and 'ambiguous', and stays quiet for 'matched' and 'none'.
Backfilling existing performers is a separate, deliberate act (a lookup per
performer at ~1.1s apiece for 164 acts), not something a schema migration
should do behind your back.

Touches neither `performance` nor `user_artist_permission`, so the hardcoded
DDL snapshots in tools/repair_stale_fk_ddl.py need no re-dump.
