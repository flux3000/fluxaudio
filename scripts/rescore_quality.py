"""
rescore_quality.py — re-score stored quality rows from cached features.

No audio decode. Use after any change to quality_scoring.py (weights, curves,
calibration constants, source offsets) so existing rows stop displaying numbers
from the previous engine.

    python3 scripts/rescore_quality.py --dry-run    # report only
    python3 scripts/rescore_quality.py              # write

Rows whose `analysis_version` is behind the current extractor are reported as
`stale_features` and SKIPPED — they predate a feature the new scoring reads, so
they need a real re-analysis (re-run Analyze in the app), not a rescore.

Context: on 2026-07-31 the engine went to score v3 (presence/scoop dropped, hum
demoted, crowd SNR added, source as an input, calibrated bands) AND to analysis
v2 (three new audience/room features). Rows written before that date are
analysis v1, so they will show up as stale_features and must be re-analysed.
