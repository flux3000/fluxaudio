"""
cleanup_orphans_and_nest_rollins.py — One-time data cleanup (2026-07-09, session 2).

Two independent operations, both approved by Ryan:

A) Delete orphaned performances (0 recordings) and their now-dangling parents.
   Failed-ingest / test residue. Deleting a performance can leave a performer
   with 0 performances; if that performer also has 0 recordings anywhere it's
   deleted too, and a canonical left with 0 linked performers is removed.
   Performers/canonicals that still have real recordings via other performances
   are untouched.

B) Nest the Sonny Rollins ensembles under canonical "Sonny Rollins".
   The "Sonny Rollins & Don Cherry Quartet" performer had lost its only
   canonical link (its 1963 recording was showing in no catalog). Link it to
   canonical "Sonny Rollins" and drop the now-redundant standalone canonical.
   (Decoupled model: canonical = grouping node; no same-named performer needed.)

Idempotent-ish: each step checks existence first. Safe to run once.

Run:
    python3 scripts/cleanup_orphans_and_nest_rollins.py --dry-run
    python3 scripts/cleanup_orphans_and_nest_rollins.py
