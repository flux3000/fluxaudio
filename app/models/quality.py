"""
models/quality.py — Listening Quality persistence.

TWO tables, deliberately, because the score has two lifecycles:

  QualityAnalysis   staging, keyed by SOURCE FOLDER PATH, pre-ingest
  RecordingQuality  permanent, keyed by RECORDING, post-ingest

Why not one table with a nullable recording_id (which looks tidier)?  Because
after a **Move** ingest the source folder no longer exists — `move_to_library()`
removes it, and the empty-parent cleanup (2026-07-22) may remove its parent too.
A folder_path-keyed row physically cannot serve as the permanent record: its key
ceases to exist at exactly the moment the permanent record is needed.  Splitting
them also gives staging rows a prunable lifecycle while permanent rows live and
die with their Recording.

On ingest commit the staging row's features/scores are copied across (see
`app/utils/quality_store.py::promote_to_recording`).

NFC WARNING: `folder_path` is ALWAYS stored NFC-normalised.  macOS hands out
decomposed (NFD) filenames while the DB holds composed (NFC), so a raw compare
silently fails on any accented name — this cost a whole afternoon on the Guitar
Trio corpus (2026-07-28).  Go through the helpers in `utils/quality_store.py`
rather than writing this column directly.

    A declarative mixin rather than a helper function: SQLAlchemy copies Column

    needed here (a single Column instance cannot belong to two tables).  Writing
    these columns out twice would guarantee the two tables drift apart on the
    next schema change.
