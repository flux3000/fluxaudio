"""
models/remote_node.py — OUTBOUND sharing: libraries I have joined as a peer.

The mirror image of models/peer.py. `peer` records who may consume MY library;
`remote_node` records whose libraries I consume. Every install carries both
tables — which side is "active" depends only on which direction data happens
to be flowing.

WHY THERE IS NO TOKEN COLUMN
----------------------------
The design spec's original sketch put `my_token` on this table. Ryan's call
(2026-08-08) was the OS keychain instead, matching the BYOK pattern in
utils/prefs.py: the DB stores a reference, never the secret.

It cannot be hashed — unlike peer_token on the inbound side, this credential
has to be replayed verbatim on every proxied request, so a one-way hash is not
an option. That leaves plaintext-in-DB or the keychain, and a database that is
copied to a dev rig, backed up, and synced is a poor home for a live credential
to someone else's library.

See app/utils/prefs.py: get_remote_token / set_remote_token / delete_remote_token.
