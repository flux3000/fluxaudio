"""
utils/venues.py — placeholder-venue detection.

Ryan's 2026-07-15 bug report: "Unknown Venue" (and similar stand-ins like
"TBD" or "N/A") were being resolved like any other venue name — matched
case-insensitively to one shared Venue row and reused across every recording
that didn't have a real venue yet. Since Venue is meant to be one canonical
physical place, this silently shared a single row's city/state/country
across shows that are, in reality, nowhere near each other — see
scripts/audit_placeholder_venues.py for the confirmed contamination (venue
#28, shared by a 1969 Denver-labeled show and a genuinely-Denver 1996 show).

A name on this list should be treated exactly like "no venue name provided
at all" everywhere a venue gets resolved or displayed as authoritative:
never create/match a Venue row for it, and let city/state/country fall
through to the Performance's own location fields instead (the same fallback
already used when there's no venue at all — see Performance's docstring).

Small and manually maintained on purpose — Ryan can extend it if he hits
other placeholder conventions in his own tagging.
