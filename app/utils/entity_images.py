"""
app/utils/entity_images.py — image behaviour shared by Performer and Venue.

Ryan's call (2026-08-07): PARALLEL TABLES, shared LOGIC. `performer_image` and
`venue_image` are separate tables so each keeps a real foreign key — this
project turned FK enforcement on deliberately in July, and a polymorphic
(entity_type, entity_id) pair cannot be enforced by SQLite at all. What is NOT
duplicated is the behaviour: one-primary maintenance, promotion on delete, and
the upload/serve/delete endpoint bodies all live here, once.

Each image model declares `__parent_fk__` (the column naming its owner), which
is the only thing that differs between them. That single hook is what lets
`set_primary()` work on either without a model argument or an isinstance ladder.

PRIMARY IS ENFORCED IN APP LOGIC. SQLite can't express "at most one row per
parent with is_primary = 1" as a partial unique index portably through
SQLAlchemy's `create_all`, so `set_primary()` clearing its siblings in the same
transaction IS the constraint. It is the only sanctioned way to set the flag.
