utils/waveform.py — Downsample a track's stored peak envelope for compact
display (Library Browse card waveform strip, 2026-08-02 design spec).

Pure function: no audio decode, no Flask, no filesystem. Takes whatever is
already sitting in TrackAnalysis.waveform_json (already parsed from JSON by
the caller) and buckets it down to `n` magnitude values (0.0-1.0), one per
bar of the strip.

Accepts both analysis shapes that exist in the live DB (see
app/utils/analysis.py):
  v2 (current) — {"min": [...], "max": [...]}, signed, -1.0..1.0, ~2000 points
  v1 (legacy)   — flat list of unsigned 0.0..1.0 RMS magnitudes, ~300 points
Older v1 rows are still real usable peaks (per the design spec's Risk
section) — not re-decoded, just accepted as-is.

    Bucket a track's peak envelope down to `n` magnitude values.

    - Empty/missing input  → n zeros (a flat strip, not an error).
    - Input shorter than n → nearest-index upsample so the strip still fills
      the requested width.
    - Input length == n    → passthrough (magnitude only).
    - Input longer than n  → n contiguous buckets, each reduced to its max
