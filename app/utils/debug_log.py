"""
utils/debug_log.py — shared in-memory debug log buffer (2026-07-19).

Was previously a module-level deque inside app/api/debug.py, holding only
entries forwarded from the JS fetch wrapper (one line per API call, AFTER it
completes). Moved here and extended with log_step() so server-side code —
scan_folder(), read_flac_tags(), parse_info_file(), Paula scoring, the bulk
ingest copy loop — can push checkpoints DURING a long-running operation, not
just report a single before/after timing line once it's over. That's the gap
that made a stuck Batch Import "Review" scan invisible: the debug panel had
no way to show anything about a request that hadn't finished yet.

Requires `threaded=True` on the Flask dev server (see run.py) to be useful —
a single-threaded server blocked on the slow request being investigated
can't also answer a request for /api/debug/live to show these checkpoints.

Process-scoped, not strictly thread-safe, but deque.append/list() are
effectively atomic under the GIL — fine for single-dev DEV_MODE use.
