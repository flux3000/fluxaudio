width_probe.py — does stereo width predict Ryan's letter grades?

Ryan's observation (2026-07-26): "In SBDs you often get a really clear, wide
stereo image, instrumentation occupying the entire field hard left and right.
AUDs will always feel more like it's coming from the centre — they can veer
towards mono-feeling in comparison. That can impact listenability."

Measured as the standard Mid/Side ratio:

    stereo_width_db = 20*log10( RMS(L-R) / RMS(L+R) )

Pure mono -> -inf. Typical stereo sits around -6 to -15 dB. Approaching 0 dB
means the sides carry as much energy as the centre: very wide.

This is a better tool than the Pearson L/R correlation already in the Defects
facet. Correlation answers "are the channels related" (a phase/wiring check);
M/S answers "how much of the signal is NOT in the centre", which is the thing
actually being perceived as width.

Deliberately NOT a source-type correction — Ryan ruled that out. This measures
the underlying property that makes soundboards feel better, without hard-coding
lineage.

Reuses the exact tracks + window offsets already chosen by the main pipeline,
read from the feature JSONs, so results line up with the existing scores.

Resumable. Usage: python3 width_probe.py <features.json> <library_root> <out.json> [budget]
